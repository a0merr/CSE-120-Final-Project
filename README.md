# Rock, Paper, Scissors – Python  
**CSE 120: Intro to Programming with Python – Final Project**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a console-based implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in Python. The program allows a user to play against the computer while validating input, tracking outcomes, and displaying results clearly.

This project was completed as the **final project for CSE 120** and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts learned throughout the course.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply core Python programming concepts
- Practice control flow and logic building
- Develop and test a complete, working program
- Clearly document and explain program behavior

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Command Line / Terminal  

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
- `while` loops for continuous gameplay
- `if / elif / else` statements for decision-making
- User input validation
- Random number generation
- Program testing and debugging
- Code documentation and explanation

---

## ▶️ How the Program Works
1. The user selects **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**
2. The computer randomly selects its choice
3. The program compares both selections
4. The winner is determined based on game rules
5. The user is prompted to play again or exit

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- The program was **tested repeatedly** with valid and invalid inputs
- Logic was verified to ensure correct outcomes for all scenarios
- Adjustments were made until the output consistently matched expected results

---

## 📄 Documentation
This project includes a **full 18-page technical document** explaining:
- Program structure
- Control flow logic
- Decision-making process
- Testing methodology
